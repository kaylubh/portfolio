      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caleb Hemphill. Iâ€™m a developer who enjoys using the flexibility of programming to overcome challenges and create better experiences. Iâ€™ve always held a strong interest in technology which I have previously neglected but refocused on in order to pursue a life and career I can be passionate about every day. I most recently worked in customer service focused roles in retail and restaurant environments, these roles taught me the importance of adapting to rapidly changing situations and working collaboratively with a team. Before that, I served nine years in the Army as an intelligence analyst where I had the opportunity to be a part of and support impactful missions in a wide variety of roles. Going forward, I hope to use my diverse background and experiences along with my reignited passion for technology to find new opportunities to use the infinite potential of computing to leave a positive impact on humanity.",
